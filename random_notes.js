// indexOf

// The indexOf() method, given one argument: a substring to search for, searches the entire calling string, and returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. Given a second argument: a number, the method returns the first occurrence of the specified substring at an index greater than or equal to the specified number.

const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?';

const searchTerm = 'dog';
const indexOfFirst = paragraph.indexOf(searchTerm);

console.log(`The index of the first "${searchTerm}" from the beginning is ${indexOfFirst}`);
// expected output: "The index of the first "dog" from the beginning is 40"

console.log(`The index of the 2nd "${searchTerm}" is ${paragraph.indexOf(searchTerm, (indexOfFirst + 1))}`);
// expected output: "The index of the 2nd "dog" is 52"


// String.prototype.lastIndexOf()

// The lastIndexOf() method, given one argument: a substring to search for, searches the entire calling string, and returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring. Given a second argument: a number, the method returns the last occurrence of the specified substring at an index less than or equal to the specified number.

const paragraph = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog barked, was it really lazy?';

const searchTerm = 'dog';

console.log(`The index of the first "${searchTerm}" from the end is ${paragraph.lastIndexOf(searchTerm)}`);
// expected output: "The index of the first "dog" from the end is 52"
